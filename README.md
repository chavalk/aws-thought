## Description

An application that allows users to upload their name, a thought, and picture to the application.

## What the project does

The project allows users to add their own thoughts to the application. They have to add their name, what they want to be included in the thought, and they can also add a picture. Users can then see the feed for all throughts or they can navigate to an individual user's profile to only see those thoughts. Below is a GIF showing how the application works.

## Why is the project useful

The project allows users to upload their own thoughts and pictures. It also allows them to see all uploaded pictures and to see one individual user's photos. On a personal level, the project allowed me to experience using DynamoDB as a database, Amazon S3 to store the images, and Amazon EC2 to deploy the project.
